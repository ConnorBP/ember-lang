# ember - design plan

C-style scripting language that JIT-compiles straight to native
x86-64, for embedding in game engines. Goal: AngelScript's binding
ergonomics, an optimizing native-JIT language's speed.

**This document is the index.** Each subsystem is fully specified in
its own detail doc under `docs/`. Read this for the shape and
cross-references; read the detail docs for the byte-level / rule-level
answers. See `RESEARCH_NOTES.md` for the prior-art survey (binprotect,
a prior native-JIT scripting language, AngelScript, Mun) that grounds every decision below.

```

One calling convention everywhere (Win64 fastcall, Windows-first).
Script-to-script and host-to-script calls both go through the
dispatch table by slot index - that single rule is what makes hot
reload, recursion, and forward references all work without special
cases. JIT only, no bytecode interpreter fallback.

## Detail docs (read in this order for a top-down picture)

| Doc | What it nails down |
|---|---|
| `RESEARCH_NOTES.md` | What was pulled from each surveyed codebase and why. Read first  -  every later doc references it. |
| `TYPE_SYSTEM.md` | Primitives, struct layout (host-mapped vs script-declared), fixed arrays, slices, the no-raw-pointer rule, implicit/explicit conversion matrix, operator result types, the unsigned-index rule that makes bounds-checking a runtime-only (not signedness) concern, `void` return-path enforcement, `auto`'s narrow scope, annotation argument grammar. |
| `COMPILER_PIPELINE.md` | Lexer token set, full BNF grammar, AST node shapes, the four sema passes in order, SSA-lite IR definition (why no phis), lowering rules per AST node, error/diagnostic model, the lower→regalloc→emit three-stage split that makes each piece independently testable. |
| `CODEGEN_SPEC.md` | The "prove we can compile to real x86-64" doc. Win64 calling convention, frame layout, exact byte encodings for the full ISA subset (integer + SSE scalar), label/patch two-pass system, linear-scan regalloc with spill rules, prologue/epilogue, script-to-script indirect calls, script-to-native calls, bounds-check emission, div/overflow traps, >4-arg spilling. Ends with 5 concrete acceptance criteria for v0.1. |
| `BINDING_API.md` | `TypeId`, `NativeParam`, `NativeFn` descriptor structs (descriptor-style, declaration-string parsing rejected), `TypeBuilder` fluent API (each method, what was trimmed from the surveyed native-JIT language's surface and why), `StructBuilder`, the script-type→Win64-slot mapping table, slice-as-two-C++-params convention, the host-side template-wrapper pattern. |
| `SAFETY_AND_SANDBOX.md` | Threat/trust model stated explicitly. Instruction budget mechanism (where counters live, what trap-on-exhaustion does), stack depth guard, bounds checking policy, `PERM_FFI` compile-time gating, the single non-local-unwind primitive that all traps funnel through, what is explicitly *not* checked (documented gaps, not oversights). |
| `HOT_RELOAD.md` | Dispatch table layout, slot-index stability invariant, single-function reload protocol (atomic slot swap, old page retired not overwritten), in-flight call behavior, recursive-function-mid-recursion reload semantics, whole-module reload, globals preserved across reload, epoch-based reclamation of retired code pages. |
| `MEMORY_AND_GC.md` | Ownership taxonomy (frame-local / host-owned / module-global / arena), the `arr[..]`-slice escape check that's the one place ember can introduce a dangling slice, module-global storage layout, string representation (rodata in the function's own code page), arena allocator design (reserved, not built in v1), explicit v2-GC deferral rationale. |
| `LIFECYCLE.md` | The native-JIT-language-equivalent of `main()` + `register_routine(cast(fn))` expressed ember's way: `@entry`/`@on_tick`/`@event(...)` annotation-based discovery + host name/slot lookup, no script-side function references needed (those are v2). |
| `GAP_ANALYSIS.md` | Systematic completeness audit: every original-request requirement → where satisfied; every feature of the surveyed native-JIT language → v1 has / deferred-with-plan / out-of-scope. Includes the honest performance caveat (ember v1 is baseline JIT, won't match an optimizing native-JIT language's speed, but beats AngelScript's bytecode interpreter). |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Every v2+ deferral with a **re-entry trigger** (the signal that says "now build this") and a **dependency** (what else must exist first). Tiered: Tier 0 standard addon set (ships v1.0), Tier 1 small lang extensions, Tier 2 function refs, Tier 3 OOP, Tier 4 GC, Tier 5 concurrency/exceptions, Tier 6 ecosystem, plus hard non-goals. |

## Goals / non-goals (restated; full reasoning in detail docs)

Goals:
- Near-native execution speed for hot game-logic scripts.
- Fast compile: JIT in microseconds-to-low-ms per function. No LLVM,
  no temp files, no dlopen.
- Safe-ish sandboxing: instruction budgets, bounds-checked access,
  no raw pointer arithmetic exposed to script, `PERM_FFI` gating.
- Simple binding API: descriptor structs, not declaration-string
  parsing.
- Hot-reload of individual script functions without invalidating
  call sites.
- JIT only.

Non-goals for v1:
- Generics / templates. Closures. A tracing GC. Multithreaded
  execution inside one context. Arbitrary pointer casts. Script-side
  `enum`/`switch`/`class`. Self-hosting.

## Milestones

- **v0.1** - hand-built IR for `fn add(i64,i64)->i64`, direct x64
  codegen, exec-memory allocator, the IR data model (`ir.hpp`), and
  the `.em` binary bundling/serialization format
  (`em_file`/`em_writer`/`em_loader`). Passes the original 5
  acceptance criteria in `CODEGEN_SPEC.md` Section 12 (int path, float path,
  forward-label fixup, spill path, recursive-via-dispatch-table) plus
  the expanded criteria in Section 15 (full Section 3 ISA byte-exact encoder
  coverage, `.em` serialize→load→run round-trip). This is the "prove
  it actually compiles to real machine code AND can be
  bundled/reloaded" gate.
- **v0.2** ✓ shipped - the full frontend landed: lexer, recursive-descent
  parser (full v1 grammar - control flow, structs, slices, switch, defer,
  ternary, compound assign, annotations), the 4-pass sema, and a
  tree-walking AST→x64 codegen. Script-to-script calls go through the
  dispatch table by slot. The `.em` bundling format (serialize→load→run
  round-trip) and cross-module textual `import "path";` inclusion both
  work. A standard addon set ships as native extensions in `extensions/`
  (vec/quat/mat/string/array/math). The canonical tree is standalone-
  buildable and standalone-testable: a prism-decoupled `ember` CLI runs
  `.ember` files, and a language regression suite (`tests/lang/` +
  `ember_check`/`sema_check` exes) runs under `ctest`.
  Honest divergence from the spec above: codegen is currently a
  correctness-first **tree-walking stack-spilling emitter**, not the
  SSA-lite IR + linear-scan regalloc specified in `COMPILER_PIPELINE.md`
  Section 5. That refactor is deliberately deferred to v0.5 (benchmark-
  driven, per Section 9 below - no speculative optimization before the
  bench harness exists).
- **v0.3** - the binding-correctness milestone. Three pieces:
  (a) a binding-ABI test suite that pins the Win64 script→native call
  ABI (struct-by-value arg/return, >4-arg spill, `f32` in xmm
  slot-parallel, slice as `ptr+len` two words — the mapping table in
  `BINDING_API.md` Section 4, now test-proven not just spec-asserted);
  (b) `BindingBuilder` (`src/binding_builder.hpp`), the ergonomic
  registration helper that dedupes the I/H/add boilerplate the six
  standard extensions each redefined — the "bindings like AngelScript"
  floor (`b.add("name", ret, {params...}, &fn)`, one call per native);
  (c) the `BINDING_API.md` truth-fix annotating that the fluent
  `TypeBuilder`/`StructBuilder`/`engine_t` surface is the v1.0 target,
  not current code, while `BindingBuilder` + the `NativeSig` map is the
  working API the extensions ship on. `PERM_FFI` is defined as a
  constant (stored on `NativeSig`) but **permission gating in codegen
  is deferred to v0.4** (v0.3 records the bit, does not yet refuse to
  marshal). `TypeBuilder`/`StructBuilder`/`engine_t` deferred to **v1.0**
  — re-entry trigger: a real host wants script-visible C++ struct types
  (the extensions use opaque `i64` handles + `StructLayoutTable`, which
  is sufficient until that trigger fires). (Note: struct
  decl/literal/field-access and the annotation machinery already landed
  in the v0.2 overshot; v0.3 is the binding-API correctness and
  host↔script calling-convention validation milestone.)
- **v0.4** - budgets/safety checks, annotations, hot reload of a
  single function, stack depth guard.
- **v0.5** - benchmark harness vs AngelScript; tune regalloc/peephole
  only if the bench shows a need.
- **v1.0** - stable native binding API, docs, example game-engine
  integration (event hooks via annotations).

## Explicitly skipped (YAGNI ladder - full per-item reasoning in the
detail docs, summarized here)

- No parser generator - grammar is small, hand-rolled recursive
  descent (`COMPILER_PIPELINE.md` Section 2).
- No LLVM/Cranelift/asmjit - own minimal encoder, ISA subset is tiny
  (`CODEGEN_SPEC.md` Section 3, `RESEARCH_NOTES.md` on binwrite/Zydis).
- No declaration-string binding parser - descriptor structs are a
  one-line call site (`BINDING_API.md` Section 1-Section 2).
- No tracing GC v1 - every reference category has a non-tracing
  lifetime (`MEMORY_AND_GC.md` Section 1, Section 8).
- No generics/closures/enum/switch v1 - no game-scripting use case
  demands them yet (`DESIGN.md` non-goals, `COMPILER_PIPELINE.md` Section 1).
- No bytecode interpreter fallback - JIT only, one execution path
  (`RESEARCH_NOTES.md` on AngelScript's bytecode-VM-by-default being
  the differentiator).
- No phi nodes in IR - slot-backed merge vars instead
  (`COMPILER_PIPELINE.md` Section 5, `CODEGEN_SPEC.md` Section 5).
- No rel8 branch shrinking, no shared-epilogue tail, no
  omit-frame-pointer, no block reordering - correctness-first v1,
  all are additive later if benchmarks justify (`CODEGEN_SPEC.md` Section 4/Section 6).
- No `goto`, no C preprocessor, no multiple inheritance / diamonds,
  no self-hosting - hard non-goals, never added (`ROADMAP.md`).
- No templates/classes/coroutines/exceptions/heap/lambdas/modules in v1
  - each is a tracked deferral with a re-entry trigger in `ROADMAP.md`,
  not a forgotten gap (`GAP_ANALYSIS.md` Section 2).
- No script-side function references / dynamic routine registration in v1
  - annotation-based static discovery covers the game-loop case
  (`LIFECYCLE.md`); dynamic registration is Tier 2 (`ROADMAP.md`).
- No builtins for arrays/maps/strings - exposed as **native addons**
  on host-owned memory (Tier 0, ships with v1.0, `GAP_ANALYSIS.md` Section 3,
  `ROADMAP.md`), not language builtins needing GC.
